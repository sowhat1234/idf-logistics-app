# Firebase Configuration (Path B - Firebase Integration Only)
# These environment variables are only needed if you choose to integrate with Firebase
# For local development (Path A), you can ignore this file

# To set up Firebase integration:
# 1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
# 2. Enable Authentication, Firestore Database, and optionally Storage
# 3. Go to Project Settings > General > Your apps
# 4. Add a web app and copy the configuration values below
# 5. Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual Firebase config values
# 6. Uncomment the variables below and replace with your Firebase project values

# Firebase API Key - Found in Firebase project settings
# VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Firebase Auth Domain - Usually your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
# VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com

# Firebase Project ID - Your Firebase project identifier
# VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Firebase Storage Bucket - Usually your_project_id.appspot.com
# VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com

# Firebase Messaging Sender ID - Numeric ID for push notifications
# VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789012

# Firebase App ID - Unique identifier for your Firebase app
# VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456789

# Additional Firebase Configuration (Optional)
# VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Development vs Production
# VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development

# Notes:
# - All variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the frontend
# - Never commit your actual .env file with real credentials to version control
# - For local development (Path A), these variables are not required
# - The app will fall back to JSON files + localStorage if Firebase is not configured
