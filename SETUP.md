### Step 1: Firebase Project Setup

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   ```bash
   # Go to Firebase Console
   https://console.firebase.google.com/
   
   # Click "Create a project"
   # Enter project name: "idf-logistics-app" (or your preferred name)
   # Enable Google Analytics (optional)
   ```

2. **Enable Required Services**
   - **Authentication**: Go to Authentication > Sign-in method > Enable Email/Password
   - **Firestore Database**: Go to Firestore Database > Create database > Start in test mode
   - **Storage** (optional): Go to Storage > Get started
   - **Hosting**: Go to Hosting > Get started

3. **Get Firebase Configuration**
   - Go to Project Settings > General > Your apps
   - Click "Add app" > Web app
   - Register app with nickname "IDF Logistics Web"
   - Copy the configuration object

### Step 2: Local Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone and install (if not done already)
git clone <repository-url>
cd idf-logistics-app
pnpm install

# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in project
firebase init
# Select: Firestore, Functions, Hosting, Storage
# Use existing project: your-project-id
# Accept defaults for most options
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your Firebase configuration
# Uncomment and fill in the values from Step 1.3
```

Example `.env` file:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyC...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789012
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Step 4: Data Migration

```bash
# Run the data migration script
node scripts/migrate-data.js

# This will:
# - Create Firestore collections
# - Migrate JSON data to Firestore
# - Create Firebase Auth accounts for demo users
# - Set up initial data structure
```

### Step 5: Deploy Firestore Rules

```bash
# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy the application
firebase deploy
```

### Step 6: Access Your Application

### Common Issues

#### Path A Issues

**Issue**: Application won't start
```bash
# Solution: Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

**Issue**: Login not working
- Verify you're using correct demo account credentials
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`

**Issue**: Data not persisting
- Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Verify you're not in incognito/private mode

#### Path B Issues

**Issue**: Firebase configuration errors
```bash
# Verify environment variables
cat .env

# Check Firebase project settings
firebase projects:list
firebase use your-project-id
```

**Issue**: Firestore permission denied
```bash
# Redeploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Check user authentication status
# Verify user roles in Firestore console
```

**Issue**: Data migration fails
```bash
# Run migration with verbose logging
DEBUG=* node scripts/migrate-data.js

# Check Firestore console for partial data
# Verify Firebase project permissions
```

### Performance Issues

**Slow loading times**
- Check network connection
- Verify Firebase project region
- Consider enabling Firestore offline persistence

**Memory issues**
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Check for memory leaks in browser dev tools
- Restart development server
